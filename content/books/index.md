I am the autor of a number of books on Java or Java-related technolgy.
My most recent books was published in 2025 and is a colloboration with José Luan Dimaz.

![Kotlin for Java Developers](/images/kotlin-small.png)

The intention of this book is to help experienced Java developers to transition to Kotlin.
While in itself the two languages have many similarities, writing idiomatic Kotlin code is no mean feat.
In this book, we explain how to do this, chapter by chapter.

The second book I wrote was again with David Vlijmincx.

In this book, we explain the inner workings of:
- Virtual Threads
- Structured Concurrency
- Scoped Values

My first book was a colloboration with David Vlijmincx.
![Cloud-native Java with Jakarta EE](/images/cloud-native-java-small.png)
It details about the migration from Java EE to Jakarta EE.
In this process, we describe what is required to transform you application from an enterprise application to a pure cloud-native application, ready for the Cloud era.
